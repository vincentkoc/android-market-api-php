## Overview
This library exposes most of the original Android Market RPCs (login,
app details, search, downloads) to PHP. **Google has never released an
official Play Store API**, so this code relies on reverse-engineered
protobuf calls that still work for many use cases.

## Connection Settings & Troubleshooting
Configure **`examples/local.php`** with:

| Setting | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| **Google Account (`USERNAME`, `PASSWORD`)** | Use an _App Password_ from a Google account with 2-step verification to reduce CAPTCHA blocks. |
| **Android Device ID** | Retrieve via the free app <https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.evozi.deviceid>. |
| **Rate-Limiting** | The Play backend will 403/400 if you spam requests. Insert `sleep()` between calls. |
| **CAPTCHA Unlock** | Log in to the same account in a browser and visit <https://accounts.google.com/DisplayUnlockCaptcha>. |
